# Architecture
This project consists of four main steps that, when put together, can run Lioness source code from a raw string to an executed result.

## Lioness pipeline

### Full pipeline:
| üõ¨ ```source code``` | ‚û°Ô∏è | Lexer 	| ‚û°Ô∏è | Parser | ‚û°Ô∏è | Compiler |  ‚û°Ô∏è | Interpreter | ‚û°Ô∏è | ```result``` üõ´ |
|---------------------- |---- |------- |---|-------- |--- |---------- |--- |------------- |--- |-------- |

The following table describes the ```I/O``` of each step in the pipeline:

|             	|       Input       	|       Output      |
|:-----------:	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:|
|    Lexer    	|    Source code    	|       Tokens      |
|    Parser   	|       Tokens      	|        AST        |
|   Compiler  	|        AST        	| [Scorpion Bytecode](Scorpion.md) |
| Interpreter 	| [Scorpion Bytecode](Scorpion.md) 	|  Execution result |

*Note: Each step in the pipeline is independent from all others. This makes unit testing very straight forward.*

#### Practical workflow:
In practice it is common to want to compile source code once and execute it multiple times. The following pipelines provide this in an efficient way:

*Pipeline 1:*

| üõ¨ ```source code``` | ‚û°Ô∏è | Lexer 	| ‚û°Ô∏è | Parser | ‚û°Ô∏è | Compiler |  ‚û°Ô∏è | ```Bytecode``` | ‚û°Ô∏è | ```encode``` üõ´ |
|----------------------|----|------- |---|-------- |----|----------|----|----------------|--- |-------- |

*Pipeline 2:*

| üõ¨ ```decode``` | ‚û°Ô∏è | ```Bytecode``` | ‚û°Ô∏è | Interpreter | ‚û°Ô∏è | ```result``` üõ´ |
|-----------------|----|--------------- |-----|------------ |----|-----------------|

The encoding/decoding will typically be followed by writing/reading the bytecode to disk, to enable efficient distribution. 

Generally the performance of the interpreter step is deemed more important than compilation time (pipeline 1). A concrete example of this is compile time code optimization: this will, by definition, slow down compilation time. But the performance gains at runtime are worth it.
